Welcome to TribeRide! This web app allows people to create and organise groups of people to ride together in a social "tribe", using either the Peloton bike or a generic spin bike with the official app.  These rides are something that you usually do at home, alone, but if you’re part of a tribe you can arrange to all take part on rides at the same time, see each other on the leaderboard and "Hi Five!" each other for encouragement, whilst at the same time to feel like you’re riding together.

Installation
Run this line first:

bundle install

add the seeds:

rake db:seed

And then execute:

$ rails s
Then navigate in your browser to:

localhost:3000
Usage
When prompted, signup or login(or use the generic admin account provided). Create a Tribe, add some rides to your tribe for others to see and perhaps join a few other tribes to take part in their rides too. A summary of all of your joined tribes and rides will be displayed on your home page
